## Description

SC Innovation Hub is a comprehensive digital platform that unifies South Carolina's fragmented tech, AI, cybersecurity, and innovation ecosystems into one centralized location. 

**What the application does:**
- Provides a searchable directory of South Carolina's innovation companies with filtering by industry and location
- Automated data extraction from multiple sources to maintain up-to-date company and event information
- Enables user authentication with both Google OAuth and traditional email/password registration
- Implements a bookmark system for users to save companies and events for future reference

**Tech stack and why we chose these technologies:**
- **Next.js 15** with App Router for optimal performance with server-side rendering and client-side interactivity
- **PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM** for robust data modeling and type-safe database operations
- **NextAuth.js** for uh... *checks notes* Authentication üëç
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS** for accessible, responsive design that works across all devices
- **Firecrawl API** for reliable, structured web scraping that maintains data quality

**Challenges faced and future features:**
We tackled the complex challenge of aggregating data from multiple disparate sources while maintaining data quality and avoiding duplicates. The current system successfully scrapes and validates company data from builtin.com, goodfirms.co, and biopharmguy.com. Future implementations will expand the event discovery system, enhance the user bookmarking interface, and add regional filtering capabilities to focus on specific areas like Mount Pleasant vs. statewide coverage.
