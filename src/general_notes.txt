Core Framework & Language
- next - React framework with server-side rendering, routing, and API routes
- react & react-dom - React library for building user interfaces
- typescript - Adds type safety to JavaScript, catches errors during development
- @types/node, @types/react, @types/react-dom - TypeScript type definitions

Styling & UI Framework
- tailwindcss - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- @tailwindcss/postcss - PostCSS plugin for Tailwind processing
- class-variance-authority - Creates reusable component variants (different button styles, etc.)
- clsx - Utility for conditionally combining CSS classes
- tailwind-merge - Intelligently merges Tailwind classes to prevent conflicts

UI Components
